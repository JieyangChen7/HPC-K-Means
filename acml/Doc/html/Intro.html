<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p><a name="index-introduction-1"></a>The AMD Core Math Library (ACML) is a set of numerical routines
tuned specifically for AMD64 platform processors (including
Opteron(TM)
 and Athlon(TM) 64
). 
The routines, which are available via both FORTRAN 77 and C interfaces,
include:

     <ul>
<li>BLAS - Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (including Sparse Level 1 BLAS);
<li>LAPACK - A comprehensive package of higher level linear algebra routines;
<li>FFT - a set of Fast Fourier Transform routines for real and complex data;
<li>RNG - a set of random number generators and statistical distribution functions. 
</ul>

   <p>The BLAS and LAPACK routines provide a portable and standard set of
interfaces for common numerical linear algebra operations
that allow code containing calls to these routines to be readily ported
across platforms. Full documentation for the BLAS and LAPACK are available
online. This manual will, therefore, be restricted to providing brief
descriptions of the BLAS and LAPACK and providing links to their
documentation and other materials
(see <a href="BLAS.html#BLAS">The BLAS</a> and see <a href="LAPACK.html#LAPACK">LAPACK</a>).

   <p>The FFT is an implementation of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
that makes use of
symmetries in the definition to reduce the number of operations required
from O(n*n) to O(n*log n) when the sequence length, n,
is the product of small prime factors; in particular, when n is a power of 2. 
Despite the popularity and widespread use of FFT algorithms, the
definition of the DFT is not sufficiently precise to prescribe either the forward
and backward directions (these are sometimes interchanged), or
the scaling factor associated with the forward and backward transforms
(the combined forward and backward transforms may only reproduce
the original sequence by following a prescribed scaling).

   <p>Currently, there is no agreed standard API for FFT routines. Hardware vendors
usually provide a set of high performance FFTs optimized for their systems:
no two vendors employ the same interfaces for their FFT routines. 
The ACML provides a set of FFT routines, optimized for
AMD64 processors, using an ACML-specific set of interfaces. The functionality,
interfaces and use of the ACML FFT routines are described below
(see <a href="FFTs.html#FFTs">Fast Fourier Transforms</a>).

   <p>The RNG is a comprehensive set of statistical distribution functions
which are founded on various underlying uniform distribution generators
<em>(base generators)</em>
including Wichmann-Hill and an implementation of the Mersenne Twister. 
In addition there are hooks which allow you to supply your own
preferred base generator if it is not already included in ACML. 
All RNG functionality and interfaces are described below
(see <a href="RNGs.html#RNGs">Random Number Generators</a>).

   <p><a href="General.html#General">General Information</a> provides details on:
     <ul>
<li>how to link a user program to the ACML;
<li>FORTRAN and C interfaces to ACML routines;
<li>how to obtain the ACML version and build information;
<li>how to access the ACML documentation. 
</ul>
