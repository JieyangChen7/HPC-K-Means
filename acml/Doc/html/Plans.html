<h4 class="subsection">5.1.4 Default and Generated Plans</h4>

<p><a name="index-FFT-plan-66"></a><a name="index-plan_002c-generated_002c-FFTs-67"></a><a name="index-plan_002c-default_002c-FFTs-68"></a>For those FFT routines that can be initialized prior to computing the
FFTs, the initialization can be performed in one of two ways. In either
case, initialization involves the storing of the factorization of N, and
the twiddle factors associated with this factorization, in the communication
array <var>COMM</var>.

   <p>The simpler way to initialize is by setting the argument <var>MODE</var> to zero. 
This means that a default plan, for the given input dimensions, is
used to calculate the FFT. This has the advantage that the initialization
phase is very quick and is generally a small fraction of the time
required to perform the FFT computation. However, for some problem
dimensions the default plan may not be optimal, especially where there
is a mixture of prime factors.

   <p>Under some circumstances, optimality of performance of an FFT
computation may be crucial. For example, where a very large number of
FFTs are to be performed on problems of a fixed size (e.g. N remains the
same), then it is best to initialize by setting the argument <var>MODE</var>
to 100. This will time a number of plans (this number can be quite large
when N has a significant number of prime factors) and initialize using
the plan with the best time. Using this form of initialization can,
potentially, lead to significant improvements in the performance of the
FFT computation for the given dimensions.

   <p>Where problem dimensions will not change over a number of runs of a
program, the communication array could, for example, be written out to a
file during an initialization run, and then read in from the same file on
subsequent computation runs. This would be effective for problem
dimensions that have a large number of possible plans (factor orderings
and groupings) and therefore take a significant amount of time to find
the optimal plan.

   <p>Please consult the individual FFT routine documents to determine whether
plan generation is enabled.
