<h3 class="section">2.2 Accessing the Library (Linux)</h3>

<p><a name="index-accessing-ACML-_0028Linux_0029-5"></a><a name="index-linking-with-Linux-ACML-6"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">2.2.1 Accessing the Library under Linux using GNU gfortran/gcc</h4>

<p><a name="index-accessing-ACML-_0028GNU-gfortran_002fgcc-under-Linux_0029-7"></a>
If the Linux 64-bit gfortran version of ACML was installed in the default directory,
/opt/acml5.3.1/gfortran64, then the command:

<pre class="example">     gfortran -m64 driver.f -L/opt/acml5.3.1/gfortran64/lib -lacml
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">can be used to compile the program driver.f and link it to the ACML.

   <p>The command

<pre class="example">     gfortran -m64 -mavx -mfma4 driver.f \
              -L/opt/acml5.3.1/gfortran64_fma4/lib -lacml
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will compile and link a 64-bit program with the 64-bit FMA4 ACML.  The Fortran module driver.f will be compiled using AVX and FMA4 instructions where possible in lieu of SSE/SSE2.

   <p>The ACML Library is supplied in both static and shareable versions,
libacml.a and libacml.so, respectively. By default, the commands
given above will link to the shareable version of the library, libacml.so,
if that exists in the directory specified. Linking with the
static library can be forced either by using the compiler
flag <tt>-static</tt>, e.g.

<pre class="example">     gfortran -m64 driver.f \
              -L/opt/acml5.3.1/gfortran64/lib -static -lacml -lrt
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or by inserting the name of the static library explicitly in the
command line, e.g.

<pre class="example">     gfortran -m64 driver.f /opt/acml5.3.1/gfortran64/lib/libacml.a -lrt
</pre>
   <p>Notice that if the application program has been linked
to the shareable ACML Library, then before running the program, the
environment variable <samp><span class="env">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span></samp> must be set. Assuming that
libacml.so was installed in the directory
/opt/acml5.3.1/gfortran64/lib, then
<samp><span class="env">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span></samp> may be set by, for example, the C-shell command

<pre class="example">     setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /opt/acml5.3.1/gfortran64/lib
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(See the man page for ld(1) for more information
about <samp><span class="env">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span></samp>.)

   <p>If you have an SMP machine and want to take best advantage of it, link against
the gfortran OpenMP version of ACML like this:
<pre class="example">     gfortran -fopenmp -m64 driver.f \
              -L/opt/acml5.3.1/gfortran64_mp/lib -lacml_mp
</pre>
   <p>Note that the directories and library names involved now include the
suffix <em>_mp</em>.

   <p>To compile and link a 64-bit C program with a 64-bit ACML, invoke

<pre class="example">     gcc -m64 -I/opt/acml5.3.1/gfortran64/include driver.c \
         -L/opt/acml5.3.1/gfortran64/lib -lacml -lgfortran
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The switch "-I/opt/acml5.3.1/gfortran64/include"
tells the compiler to search the directory
/opt/acml5.3.1/gfortran64/include for the ACML C header file
acml.h, which should be included by driver.c. 
Note that it is necessary to add the gfortran compiler run-time library
-lgfortran when linking the program.

<h4 class="subsection">2.2.2 Accessing the Library under Linux using PGI compilers pgf77/pgf90/pgcc</h4>

<p><a name="index-accessing-ACML-_0028PGI-pgf77_002fpgf90_002fpgcc-under-Linux_0029-8"></a>
Similar commands apply for the PGI versions of ACML. For example,

<pre class="example">     pgf77 -tp=k8-64 -Mcache_align driver.f -L/opt/acml5.3.1/pgi64/lib -lacml
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will compile driver.f and link it to the ACML 64-bit
version. In the example above we are linking with the
single-processor PGI version of ACML.

   <p>The command

<pre class="example">     pgf77 -tp=bulldozer -Mcache_align -pgf90libs driver.f \
           -L/opt/acml5.3.1/pgi64_fma4/lib -lacml
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will compile and link a 64-bit program with the 64-bit FMA4 ACML.  The Fortran module driver.f will be compiled using AVX and FMA4 instructions where possible instead of SSE/SSE2.

   <p>If you have an SMP machine and want to take best advantage of it, link against
the PGI OpenMP version of ACML like this:
<pre class="example">     pgf77 -tp=k8-64 -mp -Mcache_align driver.f \
           -L/opt/acml5.3.1/pgi64_mp/lib -lacml_mp
</pre>
   <p>Note that the directories and library names involved now include the
suffix <em>_mp</em>.

   <p>The -mp flag is important - it tells pgf77
to link with the appropriate compiler OpenMP run-time library. Without
it you might get an "unresolved symbol" message at link time. The
-Mcache_align flag is also important - it tells the compiler to align
objects on cache-line boundaries.

   <p>The commands
<pre class="example">     pgcc -c -tp=k8-64 -mp -Mcache_align \
           -I/opt/acml5.3.1/pgi64_mp/include driver.c
     pgcc -tp=k8-64 -mp -Mcache_align driver.o \
           -L/opt/acml5.3.1/pgi64_mp/lib -lacml_mp -lpgftnrtl -lm
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will compile driver.c and link it to the 64-bit ACML. Again, the -mp
flag is important if you are linking to the PGI OpenMP version of ACML. 
The C compiler is instructed to search the directory
/opt/acml5.3.1/pgi64_mp/include for the ACML C header file
acml.h, which should be included by driver.c, by using the switch
"-I/opt/acml5.3.1/pgi64_mp/include". 
Note that in the example
we add the libraries -lpgftnrtl and -lm to the link command, so that
required PGI compiler run-time libraries are found.

   <p>Note that since ACML version 3.5.0, all PGI 64-bit
variants are compiled with the PGI -Mlarge_arrays switch to allow use of larger
data arrays (see PGI compiler documentation for more information). 
The special 'large array' variants that were distributed with earlier
versions of ACML are therefore no longer required.

<h4 class="subsection">2.2.3 Accessing the Library under Linux using Open64 compilers openf95/opencc</h4>

<p><a name="index-accessing-ACML-_0028Open64-openf95_002fopencc-under-Linux_0029-9"></a>
Similar commands apply for the Open64 versions of ACML. For example,

<pre class="example">     openf95 driver.f -L/opt/acml5.3.1/open64_64/lib -lacml
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will compile driver.f and link it to the ACML 64-bit
version. In the example above we are linking with the
single-processor open64 version of ACML.

   <p>The command

<pre class="example">     openf95 driver.f -L/opt/acml5.3.1/open64_64_fma4/lib -lacml
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will compile and link a 64-bit program with the 64-bit FMA4 ACML.  The Fortran module driver.f will be compiled using AVX and FMA4 instructions where possible in lieu of SSE/SSE2.  The open64 compiler automatically detects AVX/FMA4 capability on the host CPU and will use these instructions if the CPU supports them.

   <p>If you have an SMP machine and want to take best advantage of it, link against
the open64 OpenMP versions of ACML like this:
<pre class="example">     openf95 -mp driver.f \
              -L/opt/acml5.3.1/open64_64_mp/lib -lacml_mp
</pre>
   <p>Note that the directories and library names involved now include the
suffix <em>_mp</em>.

   <p>The commands
<pre class="example">     opencc -c -I/opt/acml5.3.1/open64_64/include driver.c
     opencc driver.o -L/opt/acml5.3.1/open64_64/lib -lacml -lfortran
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will compile driver.c and link it to the 64-bit ACML. 
The switch
<pre class="example">     -I/opt/acml5.3.1/open64_64/include
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">tells the C compiler to search directory
/opt/acml5.3.1/open64_64/include for the ACML C header file
acml.h, which should be included by driver.c. Note that in the example
we add the library -lfortran to the link command, so that
the required Open64 compiler run-time library is found.

<h4 class="subsection">2.2.4 Accessing the Library under Linux using the NAGWare f95 compiler</h4>

<p><a name="index-accessing-ACML-_0028NAGware-f95-compiler-under-Linux_0029-10"></a>
Similar commands apply for the NAGware f95 versions of ACML. For example,

<pre class="example">     f95 driver.f -L/opt/acml5.3.1/nag64/lib -lacml
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will compile driver.f and link it to the ACML using the 64-bit
version.

<h4 class="subsection">2.2.5 Accessing the Library under Linux using the Intel ifort compiler</h4>

<p><a name="index-accessing-ACML-_0028Intel-ifort-under-Linux_0029-11"></a>
Similar commands apply for the Intel ifort versions of ACML. For example,

<pre class="example">     ifort driver.f -L/opt/acml5.3.1/ifort64/lib -lacml
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will compile driver.f and link it to the ACML using the 64-bit
version.

   <p>The commands
<pre class="example">     gcc -c -I/opt/acml5.3.1/ifort64/include driver.c
     ifort -nofor-main driver.o -L/opt/acml5.3.1/ifort64/lib -lacml
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will compile driver.c and link it to the 64-bit ACML. 
The switch
<pre class="example">     -I/opt/acml5.3.1/ifort64/include
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">tells the C compiler to search directory
/opt/acml5.3.1/ifort64/include for the ACML C header file
acml.h, which should be included by driver.c. Note that in the example
we link the C program using the ifort compiler with the -nofor-main switch,
so that required ifort compiler run-time libraries are found.

   <p>If you have an SMP machine and want to take best advantage of it, link against
the ifort OpenMP version of ACML like this:
<pre class="example">     ifort -openmp driver.f -L/opt/acml5.3.1/ifort64_mp/lib -lacml_mp
</pre>
   <p>Note that the directories and library names involved now include the
suffix <em>_mp</em>.

   <p>The -openmp flag is important - it tells ifort
to link with the appropriate compiler OpenMP run-time library. Without
it you might get an "unresolved symbol" message at link time.

<h4 class="subsection">2.2.6 Accessing the Library under Linux using Absoft af90</h4>

<p><a name="index-accessing-ACML-_0028Absoft-af90-under-Linux_0029-12"></a>
The Absoft compiler af90 is compatible with the GNU compiler gfortran
version of ACML, so long as the appropriate gfortran run-time libraries
are installed on your system. 
If the Linux 64-bit gfortran version of ACML was installed in the default directory,
/opt/acml5.3.1/gfortran64, then the command:

<pre class="example">     af90 -m64 driver.f -L/opt/acml5.3.1/gfortran64/lib -lacml -lgfortran
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">can be used to compile the program driver.f and link it to the ACML. Note that -gfortran
links to the gfortran run-time library, which must be installed on your system.

   <p>The ACML Library is supplied in both static and shareable versions,
libacml.a and libacml.so, respectively. By default, the commands
given above will link to the shareable version of the library, libacml.so,
if that exists in the directory specified. Linking with the
static library can be forced either by using the compiler
flag <tt>-static</tt>, e.g.

<pre class="example">     af90 -m64 driver.f -L/opt/acml5.3.1/gfortran64/lib -static \
          -lacml -lgfortran -lrt
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or by inserting the name of the static library explicitly in the
command line, e.g.

<pre class="example">     af90 -m64 driver.f /opt/acml5.3.1/gfortran64/lib/libacml.a \
          -lgfortran -lrt
</pre>
   <p>Notice that if the application program has been linked
to the shareable ACML Library, then before running the program, the
environment variable <samp><span class="env">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span></samp> must be set. Assuming that
libacml.so was installed in the directory
/opt/acml5.3.1/gfortran64/lib, then
<samp><span class="env">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span></samp> may be set by, for example, the C-shell command

<pre class="example">     setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /opt/acml5.3.1/gfortran64/lib
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(See the man page for ld(1) for more information
about <samp><span class="env">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span></samp>.)

   <p>If you have an SMP machine and want to take best advantage of it, link against
the gfortran OpenMP version of ACML like this:
<pre class="example">     af90 -m64 driver.f -L/opt/acml5.3.1/gfortran64_mp/lib \
          -lacml_mp -lgfortran -lgomp
</pre>
   <p>Note that the directories and library names involved now include the
suffix <em>_mp</em>. Also note that it is necessary to link to the gfortran
run-time libraries -lgfortran -lgomp, both of which must be installed
on your system.

<h4 class="subsection">2.2.7 Accessing the Library under Linux using compilers other than GNU, PGI, Open64, NAGWare, Intel or Absoft</h4>

<p><a name="index-accessing-ACML-_0028other-compilers-under-Linux_0029-13"></a>
It may be possible to link to some versions of ACML using compilers
other than those already mentioned, if they are compatible with one
of the other versions. If you do this, it may be necessary to link
to the run-time library of the compiler used to build the ACML you
link to, in order to satisfy run-time symbols. Since doing this is
very compiler-specific, we give no further details here.
