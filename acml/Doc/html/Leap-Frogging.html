<a name="index-multiple-streams_002c-leap-frogging-559"></a><a name="index-multiple-streams_002c-NAG-basic-generator-560"></a><a name="index-multiple-streams_002c-Wichmann_002dHill-generator-561"></a><a name="index-multiple-streams_002c-L_0027Ecuyer_0027s-combined-recursive-generator-562"></a>
Independent sequences of variates can be generated from a single base
generator through the use of leap-frogging.  This method involves
splitting the sequence from a single generator into k disjoint
subsequences. For example:
Subsequence 1: x(1),x(k + 1),x(2 * k + 1), ...,
Subsequence 2: x(2),x(k + 3),x(2 * k + 3), ...,
Subsequence k: x(k),x(2 * k),x(3 * k), ... 
each subsequence is then provides an independent stream.

<p>The leap-frog algorithm therefore requires the generation of every
kth variate of a sequence. Due to their form this can be done
efficiently for linear congruential generators and multiple
congruential generators. The ACML provides leap-frogging for the NAG
Basic generator, the Wichmann-Hill generators and L'Ecuyer's Combined
Recursive generator.

   <p>As an illustrative example, a brief description of the algebra behind
the implementation of the leap-frog algorithm (and block-splitting
algorithm) for a linear congruential generator (LCG) will be given. A
linear congruential generator has the form
x(i+1) = a1 * x(i) mod m1. 
The recursive nature of a LCG means that
x(i + v) = a1 * x(i + v - 1) mod m1 = a1 * [a1 * x(i + v - 2) mod m1] mod m1 = a1^2 * x(i + v - 2) mod m1 = a1^v * x(i) mod m1. 
The sequence can be quickly advanced v places by multiplying
the current state
(x(i)), by a1^v mod m1,
 hence allowing block-splitting. Leap-frogging is implemented by using
a1^k
where k is the number of streams required, in place of
a1
in the standard LCG recursive formula. In a linear congruential generator
the multiplier
a1
is constructed so that the generator has good statistical properties
in, for example, the spectral test. When using leap-frogging to
construct multiple streams this multiplier is replaced with
a1^k
 and there is no guarantee that this new multiplier will have suitable
properties especially as the value of k depends on the number
of streams required and so is likely to change depending on the
application. This problem can be emphasised by the lattice structure
of LCGs.

   <p>Note that, due to rounding, a sequence generated using leap-frogging and
a sequence constructed by taking every kth value from a set of
variates generated without leap-frogging may differ slightly. These differences
should only affect the least significant digit.
