<h3 class="section">4.1 Introduction to LAPACK</h3>

<p>LAPACK ([5]) is a library of FORTRAN 77 subroutines for
solving commonly occurring
problems in numerical linear algebra. LAPACK components
can solve systems of linear
equations, linear least squares problems, eigenvalue problems and singular
value problems. Dense and banded matrices are provided for, but not general
sparse matrices. In all areas, similar functionality is provided for real and
complex matrices.

   <p>LAPACK routines are written so that as much as possible of the computations
is performed by calls to the BLAS. The efficiency of LAPACK routines depends,
in large part, on the efficiency of the BLAS being called. Block algorithms
are employed wherever possible to maximize the use of calls to level 3 BLAS,
which generally run faster than lower level BLAS due to the high number
of operations per memory access.

<!-- @subsection -->
   <p>The performance of
some of the LAPACK routines has been further improved by reworking the
computational algorithms. Some of the LAPACK routines contained
in ACML are therefore based on code that is different from the
LAPACK sources available in the public domain. In all these cases the
algorithmic and numerical properties of the original LAPACK routines have
been strictly preserved. Furthermore, key LAPACK routines have been
treated using OpenMP to take advantage of multiple processors when running on
SMP machines. Your application will automatically benefit when you
link with the OpenMP versions of ACML.
